# IFC-Derivative-Signal-Processing

This repository contains MATLAB code, synthetic data generation scripts, benchmark tools, and real-time classification pipelines for the derivative-based signal processing method developed for impedance flow cytometry (IFC).

## Project Overview

The derivative-based method offers a lightweight, real-time alternative to traditional frequency-domain filtering for analyzing IFC signals. It enables robust detection, segmentation, and reconstruction of cellular or particle events under various noise and experimental conditions. This repository includes:

+ Synthetic signal generator with configurable noise parameters

+ Derivative-based signal processing and bi-Gaussian reconstruction

+ Traditional and notch-filter-based processing for comparison

+ Real-time classification pipeline with feature extraction and trained model

+ Benchmark results and performance plots

+ Experimental data validation scripts
